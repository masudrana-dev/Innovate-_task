Innovate Intern Task

Starting Command : npm run dev
css framework : tailwind.css
plugins : raect-slick-slider , react-icons , react-slick-carousel

Note:
I am sincerely sorry, because I have done the entire project with React because of my lack of NextJS skills. I am in the beginner level of NextJS. But if I am given the opportunity of intern then I will try my best to perform well by learning NextJS in these few days. I hope you'll consider my point!
