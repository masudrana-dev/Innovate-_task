<h1>Innovate Intern Task</h1>

<p>Starting Command : npm run dev</p>
<p>css framework : tailwind.css</p>
<p>plugins : raect-slick-slider , react-icons , react-slick-carousel</p>

<p>Note:
I am sincerely sorry, because I have done the entire project with React because of my lack of NextJS skills. I am in the beginner level of NextJS. But if I am given the opportunity of intern then I will try my best to perform well by learning NextJS in these few days. I hope you'll consider my point!</p>
